# Sticky Navigation

You can use this module to make an element (such as the navigation menu or
the header region) become sticky at the top of the page when a long page
is scrolled.

## How to Install and Configure

1. Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)
2. Go to **Configuration > User Interface > Sticky Nav Settings**
   (`admin/config/user-interface/stickynav`) to configure.
3. Activate the module for the themes you want Sticky Navigation to
   function on.
4. Place a jQuery format selector (e.g. `ul.menu` or `.l-header`) into the
   Selector field for each activated theme.

Note that this functionality may not look good on every theme out of the box.
You might have to adjust the styling (such as the background color of the
element you've selected to make sticky).

Further instructions can be [viewed and edited in the Wiki](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/stickynav/wiki).
